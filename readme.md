# PlacesOfInterest #

A ruby remix of the app developed on [Ray Wenderlich's site](http://www.raywenderlich.com/146436/augmented-reality-ios-tutorial-location-based-2) that displays map annotations of nearby places of interest, and can guide you to the locations using augmented reality.

### Tips for Using the App
When initiating AR guidance, the target placement is only as good as the device's orientation accuracy. You'll see the best results if you start the AR guidance from a stationary position and with the device's back horizontal to the ground. 

Additionally, ARKit uses information from the device's camera, so ensure it gets a clear view of your surrounding environment when in AR mode.
